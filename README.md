### one
```
Too lazy to be ambitious
I let the world take care of itself.
Ten days worth of rice in my bag
A bundle of twigs by the fireplace.
Why chatter
about delusion and enlightenment?
Listening to the night rain
on my roof,
I sit comfortably
with both legs stretched out
```
### two
```
My hut lies in the middle of a dense forest;
Every year the green ivy grows longer.
No news of the affairs of men,
Only the occasional song of a woodcutter.
The sun shines and I mend my robe;
The moon shines and I read Buddhist poems.
I have nothing to report to my friends.
If you want to find the meaning, stop chasing after
so many things.
```
### three
```
You Already Know the Answer

Throw away
your clothes
and burn all your books,
but it won't do you any good.

Learn
from the past
and live in the moment,
but still you'll find no truth.

Yes,
climb the mountain
and sit outside the temple,
but the master
won't open the door.

You already know
the road you have to take,
but you don't have
the strength to walk it.

Do you?
```
### four
```
Yes, I'm truly a dunce
Living among trees and plants.
Please don't question me about illusion and enlightenment
This old fellow just likes to smile to himself.
I wade across streams with bony legs,
And carry a bag about in fine spring weather.
That's my life,
And the world owes me nothing.
The gaudy beauty of this world has no
attraction for me-
My closest friends are mountains and rivers,
Clouds swallow up my shadow as I walk along,
When I sit on cliffs, birds soar overhead.
Wearing snowy straw sandals, I visit cold
villages.
Go as deep as you can into life,
And you will be able to let go of even blossoms.
```
### five
```
Blending with the wind,
Snow falls;
Blending with the snow,
The wind blows.
By the hearth
I stretch out my legs,
Idling my time away
Confined in this hut.
Counting the days,
I find that February, too,
Has come and gone
Like a dream.
```
### six
```
Someday I'll be a weather-beaten skull resting
on a grass pillow,
Serenaded by a stray bird or two.
Kings and commoners end up the same,
No more enduring than last night's dream.
```
